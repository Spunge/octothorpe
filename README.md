### TODO 
Patterns
- [ ] Grid click activates / deactivates note
- [ ] row 0x31 (solo cue) -> change pattern length
- [ ] row 0x32 (activator) -> zoom pattern
- [ ] shift + row 0x32 (activator) -> move zoom viewport
- [ ] bank select moves viewport in all directions, also moving zoom indicator
- [ ] scene lauch row selects patterns

Phrases
- [ ] stop all clips => phrase mode

Instruments
- [ ] track selection row switches between instuments
- [ ] master switches between first & second group of 8 instuments
- [ ] row 0x30 (record arm) -> instrument outputs yes/no

Tempo
- [ ] Fix tap tempo

Effect knobs
- [ ] Send knobs input to output directly for channel of selected instrument


### Idea / unsure about
Velocity
- Show velocity of notes in grid by color of note
- Use indicator bar for selecting velocity when grid note is pressed
