Turn your APC40 into a step sequencer


### TODO 
Patterns
- [ ] Grid click activates / deactivates note with current velocity
- [ ] row 0x31 -> change pattern length
- [ ] shift + row 0x31 -> change velocity level
- [ ] row 0x32 -> move zoom viewport
- [ ] shift + row 0x32 -> change zoom level
- [ ] bank select moves viewport in all directions, also moving zoom indicator
- [ ] scene lauch row selects patterns

Phrases
- [ ] stop all clips => phrase mode

Instruments
- [ ] track selection row switches between instuments
- [ ] master switches between first & second group of 8 instuments
- [ ] row 0x30 (record arm) -> instrument outputs yes/no

Tempo
- [ ] Fix tap tempo

Effect knobs
- [ ] Send knobs input to output directly for channel of selected instrument


### Idea / unsure about
Velocity
- Show velocity of notes in grid by color of note?

Effect knobs
- Record effect knobs into patterns
